run_analysis.R does the following: 
- Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
- Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
- Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
- Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names. 
- Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
